# Cookie Flavor Generator

This skill helps you dream up creative and innovative cookie flavors by combining ingredients, techniques, and inspirations in novel ways.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Users ask for cookie flavor ideas or suggestions
- Someone wants to create a unique cookie recipe
- A user mentions ingredients and wants cookie pairing ideas
- Creative brainstorming for bakery products is needed
- Converting other dessert flavors into cookie form

## Flavor Generation Framework

### 1. Core Components

Every cookie flavor should consider these elements:
- **Base**: The foundation (classic sugar, chocolate, oatmeal, shortbread, etc.)
- **Dominant Flavor**: The star ingredient (fruit, spice, nut, chocolate variant)
- **Complementary Elements**: Supporting flavors that enhance the dominant flavor
- **Texture**: Mix-ins for textural contrast (chips, chunks, swirls, crunchy bits)
- **Finishing Touch**: Optional glaze, drizzle, or topping

### 2. Flavor Pairing Principles

Follow these guidelines for successful combinations:
- **Sweet + Salt**: Balance sweetness with a salty element
- **Rich + Bright**: Pair rich/heavy flavors with citrus or fruit
- **Spice + Warmth**: Combine warming spices with complementary sweet notes
- **Texture Contrast**: Mix soft with crunchy, chewy with crisp
- **Seasonal Inspiration**: Consider seasonal ingredients and occasions

### 3. Generation Process

When generating cookie flavors:

1. **Understand the Request**
   - What occasion or season is this for?
   - Any dietary restrictions or preferences?
   - Desired complexity (simple vs. gourmet)?
   - Any specific ingredients to feature or avoid?

2. **Create Base Concept**
   - Start with a base cookie type
   - Choose 1-2 dominant flavors
   - Consider the flavor profile (sweet, spicy, fruity, nutty, etc.)

3. **Build Complexity**
   - Add complementary flavors (2-3 elements maximum)
   - Incorporate texture elements
   - Consider visual appeal
   - Add finishing touches

4. **Name Creation**
   - Create an appealing, descriptive name
   - Make it memorable and evocative
   - Consider alliteration or playful language

5. **Recipe Sketch** (if requested)
   - Base dough type and modifications
   - Key ingredients and proportions
   - Mix-ins and timing
   - Baking notes
   - Finishing instructions

### 4. Flavor Categories for Inspiration

Reference these categories when ideating:

**Classic Elevated**
- Take traditional flavors and add sophisticated twists
- Example: Brown Butter Chocolate Chip with Sea Salt

**Global Fusion**
- Incorporate international flavors and ingredients
- Example: Matcha White Chocolate with Black Sesame

**Dessert Translation**
- Convert popular desserts into cookie form
- Example: Tiramisu Cookies with Coffee and Mascarpone

**Seasonal Specials**
- Leverage seasonal produce and holiday themes
- Example: Cranberry Orange with White Chocolate (winter)

**Unexpected Savory-Sweet**
- Balance savory elements with sweetness
- Example: Rosemary Lemon with Olive Oil

**Nostalgic Comfort**
- Evoke childhood memories with familiar flavors
- Example: Peanut Butter & Jelly Thumbprints

## Working with References

If users want deep flavor pairing knowledge, you can reference `references/flavor-profiles.md` for detailed ingredient compatibility charts.

## Tips for Success

- Keep dominant flavors to 2-3 maximum - more becomes muddled
- Always consider texture balance
- Think about aroma as well as taste
- Consider the "story" behind the flavor
- Don't be afraid to be creative, but ensure combinations make sense
- Test concepts mentally: would you want to eat this?

## Restrictions

- Avoid combinations that would be structurally unstable
- Don't suggest raw ingredients that shouldn't be eaten uncooked
- Consider allergen information when relevant
- Keep recipes realistic for home bakers unless specifically asked for professional techniques
